# Medical-No-Show-Appointments
Udacity Data Analyst - Project II
## summary:
This dataset collects information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and focuses on the question of whether patients will show up for their appointments or not. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- “Scheduled Day” tells us on which day the patient has scheduled his appointment.
- "Neighborhood" refers to the location of the hospital.
- “Scholarship” indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Brazilian Bolsa Família healthcare programme.
- “No_show” says “no” if the patient comes to his appointment, and “yes” if he does not.
## Answering Questions:
- How many patients come for their appointments, whether female or male?
- What is the percentage of patients who attend their appointments (females, males)?
- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
- Are the messages sent proof that patients attend their appointments?
- Are patients who attend their appointments enrolled in the healthcare program? or not?
## Statistical Analysis Scope:
Using the process of data analysis to explore a data set, we answer the questions we were interested in through the scope of the statistical analysis:
1. Data Wrangling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Data visualizations.
4. make conclusions.
